NOTE:

    It is expected that if any changes occur in the base '_branding.scss'
    file it is also copied over to all other sass directories that refer to branding.

    as there is not a convenient way to automatically include these variables from modifying the
    origional located in '.../HydroLearn/src/static/sass'
